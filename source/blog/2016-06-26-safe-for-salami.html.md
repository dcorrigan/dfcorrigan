I'm reading Svetlana Alexievich's _Secondhand Time_, a collection of oral histories about the fall of the USSR. My previous knowledge of Soviet history only extended as far as being able to name the General Secretaries of the Communist Party after Stalin in order. (This isn't impressive. There were only five of them, plus one who apparently held office for six days after Gorbachev resigned, says [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Secretary_of_the_Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union).) Alexievich's book is not rote history like that, though. The book is fluid: voices condemn or approve _perestroika_ and talk at length about the kitchen table as a center for Russian political thought. Others talk about themselves as orphans of the motherland, or rehearse the sad details of husbands and sons who were killed or killed themselves. Invariably, though, they mention the post-Soviet abundance of salami:

> Happiness is here, huh? Sure, there's salami and bananas. [p. 21]

> We were greeted by a strange, unfamiliar city [. . .] [E]verywhere you went, you saw gray rows of people peddling lingerie and sheets, old shoes and toys, loose cigarettes. On beds of torn paper, in cardboard laid directly on the ground, you'd find salami, meat, and fish. [p. 94]

> People dreamt that tons of salami would appear at the stores at Soviet prices and members of the Politburo would stand in line for it along with the rest of us. Salami is the benchmark of our existence. Our love for salami is existential . . . [p. 162]

Salami holds a central place in Russian gastronomy. It was nearly unattainable under the old regime and is now a capitalist excess under the new. Few people in the book miss the Stalinist purges and the coldest machinery of the Soviet Republic, but many miss the days when Soviet poets could fill stadiums. Salami, for them, is attendant to spiritual poverty. 

I haven't had any Russian meats. My closest luxury is soppressata, and regardless of the spiritual economics, I would miss it if it were gone.
