Below is my admittedly bad, quick sketch using Tim Holman's Javascript/HTML5 tool, "[texter](http://tholman.com/texter/)". "texter" is a clever diversion, and maybe that's all. I like it because it treats words as just another drawing tool. I cropped this image freely, which somehow felt like I was breaking a rule.

Digital text is ephemeral in a way that's distinct from newspaper and leaflets. Its substrate is persistent; the screen stays put while newsprint and other shit-papers degrade in landfills or anywhere they happened to be dropped in Philadelphia. Printed text is married to its surface. Digital text is fungible. "texter" is maybe a vey literal extension of that, making words a decorative, renewable medium. And anything you doodle long enough will become like lace, just another kind of screen, almost opaque.

This is another one, because I can't help myself:
